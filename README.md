# Rock, Gamble, Shoot!

Want to have some fun with your friends? Run this gamble!

To find out what it does, read the .py-files (ruins the surprise) although you may customize these to make it even more hardcore!

## Dependencies (Only needed for compiling)

1. pyinstaller

   `pip install pyinstaller`

## Supported platforms

Unfortunately this only supports Windows at the moment because of OS specific commands.

## To compile to .exe

It's actually really easy to compile since we use pyinstaller!

#### For the milder version:

`pyinstaller -F mild.py`

#### For the more hardcore version:

`pyinstaller -F hard.py`
